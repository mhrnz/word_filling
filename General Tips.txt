1- in a principal module you should not use file related functions such as pickle or ...
   they should be used in the main part of the code or in an extra module
2- the modules should be as independent as possible etc, words_to_int, get_words
3- it is better to define the blank parameter as an input instead of middle
4- I changed some parts and commented some others so the code maybe inconsistent
